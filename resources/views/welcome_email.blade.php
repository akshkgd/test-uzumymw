<p class="lead">Welcome to the Codekaro Family! We are delighted to have you join us and we canâ€™t wait to make a positive contribution to your career! <br><br>

    Codekaro was started with the vision of <u>helping students, independent of background, education and experience,</u> upskill themselves and develop into rockstar computer engineers. Through our combined decades of experience in the software industry, we realised early on that three things truly help create a differential career trajectory - <b>quality teaching, experienced mentorship and real-world practice </b>. Codekaro aims to <b>democratize access</b> to all of these for you. <br> <br>
    
    
    We are always looking to hear about your experience with our product and our team. Feel free to reach out at info@codekaro.in for any feedback or questions. We are always listening.

Regards & Happy Coding! <br>
